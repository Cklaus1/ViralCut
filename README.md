## **Description**
ViralCutter is an innovative tool for generating viral videos from existing content. Using advanced video and audio processing techniques, ViralCutter cuts and edits video segments that are perfect for sharing on social media. Utilizing the WhisperX model for transcription and automatic subtitle generation, it adapts videos to the 9:16 (vertical) format, ideal for platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts.

## **Features**

- **Video Download**: Downloads YouTube videos via a provided URL.
- **Audio Transcription**: Converts audio to text using the WhisperX model.
- **Viral Segment Identification**: Uses AI to detect video parts with high viral potential, with automatic recommendations for maximum segments based on video duration.
- **Cutting and Format Adjustment**: Cuts selected segments and adjusts aspect ratio to 9:16.
- **Audio and Video Merging**: Combines transcribed audio with processed video clips.
- **Batch Export**: Generates a ZIP file with all created viral videos, facilitating download and sharing.
- **Custom Subtitles**: Create custom subtitles with colors, highlights, non-highlights, or word-by-word, offering extensive editing possibilities.
